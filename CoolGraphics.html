<div class="p-header" id="background">
<p> I grew up in Midland Michigan March 1st 2008. Yes, I am a 2000's kid. Growing up in a town like midland taught 
  me alot and now I shall show you that. So fasten your seatbelts grab your popcorn and try not to crash we are going for a ride. </p>

<p> I lived in good old midland till around my 7th grade year when covid happend. Covid was a hard time for all.
  since we were doing online school we decided to just move to bay city so I could go back to in person school.
  So I went to handy midway through my 7th year. I had a hard time making friend due to covid but I survived.
</p>

<p> Then I got to high school where I started to get acheviments I first got to go to a cool like speaker competiotn at ferris it was not 
  many who managed to pass. Then going into my second year of high school I got to go to robotics. I eventually got to be vice captain
  and coding lead. I got to even go in the pit my first year. So thats all my acheviments not many but hey begars can't be choosers.
