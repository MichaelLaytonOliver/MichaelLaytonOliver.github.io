<h1> <u> Michaels Hobbie</u></h1>
<p> There are two different hobbies that make me ME. One is video games for helping me out of a tough time and being there when I need.
  Video games have done alot for my life but were not the only thing. I also had robotics. Robotics took me when i was in the least
  confident version of me I can be and helped me learn and grow to be a better person. there's a lot that can be learned from robotics hence
  Why I Enjoy it.  </p>

<p> Video games are a huge part of my life. My intrest in coding started with games. My curiosity to understand how it works is what sparked
  my intrest. I would not care for coding if not for games. Also during covid i was forced to move and was kinda seperated from frendships.
  so I relied on video games for those conection and it worked. Games filled that interactions I could not get else where.
</p>

<p>Video games created a problem with my self confidents stuff robotics filled. Robotics picked me up when I was lacking confident in myself
  and forced me to take confidence. I grew to learn how to adapt to high stress scenarios and force confidence even when I did not have it.
  It requires alot of mental presure you have to adapt and learn to. It also allowed me to grown my skills in both mechanical and coding skills.
